The generated data parcels are in the `parcels` folder. The `parcels/rds` contains the parcels in R's Rds data type and the `parcels/csv` folder shows the first lines of all tables as csv files. The `parcels/table_spec/` folder shows the YAML table specifications.

To due copyright, we removed parcels that contain original text from the article.

We did not include the original supplement in order to save space.
