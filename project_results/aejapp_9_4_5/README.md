## Content

You find the generated HTML reports in the `reports` folder. The generated data parcels in the `parcels` folder. The `parcels/rds` contains the parcels in R's Rds data type and the `csv` folder shows the first lines of all tables as csv files.

To due copyright, we removed parcels that contain original text from the article.

We did not include the original supplement in order to save space.
