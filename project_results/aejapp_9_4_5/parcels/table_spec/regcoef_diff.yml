name: regcoef_diff

descr: |
  Summary information on whether regression coefficients and se
  from regcoef differ between two variants.
  E.g. if we implement the same regression in R and Stata, we would like
  the estimated coefficients to be identical or given rounding errors
  to be at least close to each other.

  The information is in R using the function "regcoef_diff". Comparison
  on level of each coefficient can be generated with the R function
  coef_diff_table but we don't store this information in the data base.

unique_index:
  main_index: [artid, step, variant1, variant2]

fields:
  artid:

  step:
    type: int

  variant1:
    descr: The first variant

  variant2:
    descr: The second variant.

  compare_what:
    decr: What do we compare?
    values: [all, coef, se]

  identical:
    descr: Are values for all coefficients exactly identical?
    type: bool

  identical_share:
    descr: Share of coefficients that are identical
    type: num

  within_1pc_share:
    descr: Share of values that have a relative difference below 1pc 0.001. NA values will be ignored.
    type: num

  within_1pm_share:
    describe: Share of values that have a relative difference below 1 per mille 0.001. NA values will be ignored.
    type: num

  max_rel_diff:
    descr: Maximum relative difference abs(x1-x2)/mean(x1+x2)
    type: num

  max_deviation:
    descr: We define as the deviation the minimum of the absolute diference abs(x1-x2)
              and the relative difference. For coefficients close to zero the relative difference
              may be large due to rounding errors, but that should not be a big problem
              if the absolute difference is quite small.
    type: num

  ref_level_differ:
    descr: Are different levels for some variables shown / dropped => Also means ref_level may differ
    type: bool

  problem:
    descr: >
      An optional text that describes some problem in this comparison.
      One example is "infeasible_filter_condition" if a Stata if condition cannot
      be properly translated to R and we would thus not expect a correct replication
      of the regressionn results.
