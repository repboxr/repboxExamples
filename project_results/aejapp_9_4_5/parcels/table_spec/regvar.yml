name: regvar

descr: >
  Contains information about the regression variables their roles and interactions,
  based on the regression formulas. We also note whether or not a variable is used
  as factor / fixed effect or numerically.

  Roles can be dependendent variable, explanatory variable, instruments, cluster, weight,
  timevar, panelvar.

  If the regression specifies interaction terms like

  x1##x2

  we have an entry for each element, i.e. x1 and x2.

  Background statistics of the variables will be stored in colstat_num and colstat_factor.

fields:
  artid:
    descr: Project name. Typically ejd id of the article like aer_101_1_5

  step:
    descr: Analysis step in the DAP of the project
    type: int

  variant:
    descr: Variant of the run regression.

  cterm:
    descr: Canoncial name of the regression variable. Does not include value for factors, e.g. 'color'

  ia_cterm:
    descr: Canonical name of interaction term this variable is a part of. If it is not part of an ia_term,
           this is simply cvar.

  basevar:
    descr: |
      Original variable in the data set from which this variable is computed from, e.g. if
      if we use Stata code to generate a lag variable, then it is the original variable name.

  role:
    descr: Role of the variable in the regression
    values: [dep, exo, endo, instr, weight, cluster]

  var_org_type:
    descr: Original type of the variable
    values: [integer, numeric, dummy, factor, date, datetime]

  var_reg_type:
    descr: Type of the variable as used in the regression
    values: [numeric, dummy, factor]

  ia_reg_type:
    descr: Type of the interaction term used in the regression. If ia_num = 1 equal to var_type.
    values: [numeric, dummy, factor, dummy_numeric, factor_numeric]

  absorbed_fe:
    descr: Only relevant for explanatory variables of ia_type=factor. Is the variable used as absorbed fixed effect?
    type: bool

  main_pos:
    descr: Position of the explanatory variable / cluster variable in the regression command
    type: int

  ia_pos:
    descr: If part of an interaction effect the position of this variable in the interaction term
    type: int

  ia_num:
    descr: Number of variables that make up an interaction term. If 1 we don't have an interaction term.
    type: int

  ia_source_expr:
    descr: Expression of the interaction term as specified in the code

  var_source_expr:
    descr: Expression of the interaction term as specified in the code

  transform:
    descr: |
      Applied transformation of the basic variable in the regression formula.

      The transformations L, F, S, D correspond to the Stata time series transformation
      operators as specified in the Stata manual:
      https://www.stata.com/manuals/u11.pdf#u11.4.4
    values: [log, L, F, S, D]
    val_descr:
      L: lag
      F: lead (forward)
      D: |
        difference to previous period value
        difference if transform_par > 1 the n'th difference
      S: |
        seasonal difference. We have D1=S1 but D2 != S2.
        If transform_par > 1 the difference to the lagged valued transform_par units ago.
  transform_par:
    descr: Parameters of the transformation. If more than one parameter, stored as a comma separated list.
