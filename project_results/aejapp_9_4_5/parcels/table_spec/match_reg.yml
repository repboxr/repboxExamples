# Fields with one entry per regression

name: match_reg

descr: |
  Summary statistic of the matching quality between article and code regression
  pairs. Contains matching score for coefficients / standard errors, as
  well as for regression statistics.
  Roughly the matching score is the average of matched numbers, but it is
  slightly adapted, e.g. a little rounding error still gives a positive score.
  Only regression pairs are considered that have at least a matching score of 0.5
  for the coefficients / se.
index:
  main_index: [artid, variant, step, regid]

fields:
  artid:
    descr: ID of the article that is analyzed.

  variant:
    descr: Variant of the supplement regression that is matched

  step:
    descr: ID of reg in supplement

  runid:
    type: int

  regid:
    descr: ID of reg in article


  paren_type:
    descr: What is most likely shown in the parentheses

  match_score:
    descr: |
      Number between 0 and 1 describing the overall match quality.
      This number only uses information from the number of matched coefficients,
      standard errors (or t / p) and matched statistics.
      It is subjectively decided how much close matches (one deci distance away)
      count.

  code_nfoundstat:
    descr: |
      Just the number of presented stats from the article that
      we could match by name, even if the values are wrong.
      Only stats that could be matched by name enter the match_core
    type: int

  tabid_ref_match:
    descr: |
      Do the tabid references from the code comment match the tabid
      from the article?
      +1 they match
      -1 don't match
      0 at least one tabid is not well specified
    type: int
