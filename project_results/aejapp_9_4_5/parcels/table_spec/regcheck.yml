name: regcheck

descr: |
  Check on whether regression did run as expected.

unique_index:
  main_index: [artid, step, variant]

fields:
  artid:

  step:
    type: int

  variant:

  did_run:
    descr: Did the step finish running?
    type: bool

  problem:
    descr: |
      A text describing potential problems. If the step did not run,
      it contains the error message.

  deviation:
    descr: |
      A numeric deviation measure. The exact details depend on the variant.
      Often it will use a value of "max_deviation" from "regcoef_diff".

      Even if no problem is described, a high deviation value may still
      indicate a problem that should be explored.
    type: num

  tolerable_deviation:
    descr: |
      A number that specifies the maximum deviation in regcheck
      that is deemed tolerable.

      This number is the subjective assessment of the metastudy designer.

      For example if we re-run the same stata code as in the original study,
      we may say the tolerable deviation is 0.
      If we translate code from Stata to R the tolerable deviation
      is usually larger.

      An NA value means that no tolerable deviation was specified,
      e.g. because it makes no sense given the definition of deviation
      for this entry.

      You typically would not fill the problem variable just because

      deviation > tolerable_deviation

      Problems correspond rather to concrete errors that occur
      when running. This inqequality can be checked seperately.
      The header table has a separate counter variable
      num_reg_excess_deviation to count regressions without other problems
      where the deviation exceeds the tolerable deviation.

    type: num


  comment:
    descr: |
      Optional additional comment. Will typically be empty.
      The comment can either provide additional information for
      a problem that may help debugging or note a point
      that shall not be considered a problem but
      may be informative nevertheless.
      Avoid excessive long comments since regcheck will be
      typically stored inside the core parcel of
      metareg studies.
