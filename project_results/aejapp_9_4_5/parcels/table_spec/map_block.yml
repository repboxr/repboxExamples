  TO DO: DONT KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH SMALL REGS:
  HOW AND WHEN WILL BLOCK BE CHANGED. WHAT ABOUT REGRESSION STATS?
  PERHAPS WE DONT USE THE BLOCK TABLE?

  A block consists of a set of cells of an article's table.

  Often a block consists of all cells in a column of a table,
  or only a subset of rows. The exact definition of a block
  depends on which cells match well together

  This means the exact definition of a block can depend what matches
  well together and not only on the information in the article

  Descripe the chosen map between table cells in an article
  and code chunks.

fields:
  mapid:
    type: int
    descr: In principle, we might consider multiple maps.

  tabpos:
    type: int

  block:
    type: int

  cmd:
    descr: We expect every block to map to a single command type

  runid:
    descr: Will only be positive if the block is supposed to map to a single command
    type: int

  regid:
    descr: Only positive if the block is matched to a regression
    type: int
