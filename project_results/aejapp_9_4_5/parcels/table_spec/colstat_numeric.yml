name: colstat_numeric

descr: >
  Contains information about numerical variables used in the regression.
  This can also contain information about generated dummies or interaction terms,
  specified by a cterm, e.g. x1=1 or x1=5:x2.

  The statistics can be used e.g. to compute normalized regression coefficients.
