# Fields with one entry per regression

name: cmdpart

descr: |
  Represents the original regression command line with different placeholders that
  can be substituted. This will allow two things:

  1. Understand structure of regression command e.g. search for standard error

  2. Easier change regression command in Stata

  To generate (or update) the cmdpart table only the cmdline shall be needed.

unique_index:
  main_index: [artid, step, part]

index:
  index2: [tag, part]

fields:
  artid:

  step:
    type: int

  parent:
    descr: Name of the parent part. Empty for the "main" part and otherwise the name
           of the parent string for which this is a part.

      in_str: The in condition including preceding "in "
      weights_str: The weights

  tag:
    descr: |
      Additional tag for the placeholder that may differ from part
      part may more often contain information about the position in the cmdline
      while tag may add information about the function inside the regression
    val_descr:
      se: For options referencing to standard errors
      xi: If the prefix is the xi command
      depvar: is the regression variable a dependent variable
      endovar: is the regression variable endogenous
