name: regxvar

descr: >
  Contains information about the expansion of interaction terms and factor levels for
  all explanatory variables in a regression.

  This table augments the regvar table. While regvar would allow to translate regression
  commands to R there is one problem: how can we drop in a translation exactly the
  same factor levels as in the original regression run.

  Here regxvar helps as we also store for each expanded term whether it is was found
  or dropped in regcoef. For a translation, we can then build a regression formula
  using the non-dropped expanded terms.

fields:
  artid:
    descr: Project name. Typically ejd id of the article like aer_101_1_5

  step:
    descr: Analysis step in the DAP of the project
    type: int

  ia_cterm:
    descr: Canonical name of interaction term this variable is a part of. If it is not part of an ia_term,
           this is simply cvar.

  cterm:
    descr: Canoncial name of the regression variable. Does not include value for factors, e.g. 'color'

  role:
    descr: Role in the regression. Here either exo, endo or instr

  in_regcoef:
    descr: Does the cterm have a non-na coefficient in the base run regcoef?
    type: bool
